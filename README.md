Custom Fonts
The website uses custom fonts, including 'Gratina' and Google Fonts



Notes
The 'Gratina' font was originally planned for the site but faced issues. The fallback font is 'Source Sans Pro'.
Ensure all image paths are correct and images are available in the 'img' directory.
The website utilizes custom properties for easy theme updates and consistency.
